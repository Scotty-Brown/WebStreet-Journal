## üå± Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:
- Project planning, time management and practicing asking clarifying questions.
  - Project Planning - [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Take-Home-Challenge-Mod-4-772f7533d09e4548888a7c654c2f2b14?pvs=4)
  - Wireframing - [Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNUWhXF0=/)
- I broke up all of my major tasks into smaller, digestible pieces. This allowed me to iterate through the project without any major blockers.
- This was only my second time working with Local Storage. Local Storage allowed me to maintain the data from the API in the event of an unintentded unmounting.

Challenges:
- One of my biggest challenges was determining the architecture of the app that made the most sense.
